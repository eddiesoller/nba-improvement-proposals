# 0600: Draft

## Summary

Define the full NBA draft order for both rounds, establishing how lottery-eligible teams, non-lottery teams, and second-round picks are sequenced based on tournament performance.

## Motivation

The draft lottery defined in [0500](0500.md) determines the order for lottery-eligible teams — those eliminated before the Conference Semifinals. But the eight teams that reached the Conference Semifinals or beyond are not lottery eligible. The current NBA system orders non-lottery teams by reverse regular season record, which reintroduces a tanking incentive for the league's best-performing teams.

This proposal extends the anti-tanking logic of [0500](0500.md) to the full draft. Non-lottery teams are ordered by reverse tournament finish, with random draws used to break ties within the same elimination round. No ordering criterion based on regular season record appears anywhere in the draft.

## Proposal

### First Round

The first round consists of 30 picks (or 32 upon expansion to 16 teams per conference).

**Picks 1–22 (15-team format) or 1–24 (16-team format):** Determined by the weighted lottery draw defined in [0500](0500.md). These are the lottery-eligible teams — all teams eliminated before the Conference Semifinals.

**Remaining picks — non-lottery teams:** The 8 teams that were not lottery eligible (those that reached the Conference Semifinals or beyond) pick last, ordered by reverse tournament finish.

| Elimination Round | Picks (15-team) | Picks (16-team) | Teams |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Conference Semifinals | 23–26 | 25–28 | 4 teams (2 per conference) |
| Conference Finals | 27–28 | 29–30 | 2 teams (1 per conference) |
| NBA Finals (runner-up) | 29 | 31 | 1 team |
| NBA Champion | 30 | 32 | 1 team |

Within the same elimination round — for example, the four Conference Semifinal losers — order is determined by a random draw conducted by the league. Regular season record is not used.

### Second Round

The second round follows the same order established in the first round. The team that held pick 1 in the first round picks first in the second round, and so on through pick 60 (or 64 upon expansion). No additional draw or mechanism is required.

This is a straight draft format. The order is not reversed or otherwise adjusted. The first-round order, which was itself determined entirely by tournament performance, governs both rounds.

### Summary Table (15-Team Format)

| Picks | Teams | Ordering Mechanism |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| 1–22 | Lottery-eligible teams | Weighted lottery draw ([0500](0500.md)) |
| 23–26 | Conference Semifinal losers | Random draw |
| 27–28 | Conference Finals losers | Random draw |
| 29 | NBA Finals runner-up | Fixed |
| 30 | NBA Champion | Fixed |
| 31–60 | All 30 teams | Same order as picks 1–30 |

### Summary Table (16-Team Format)

| Picks | Teams | Ordering Mechanism |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| 1–24 | Lottery-eligible teams | Weighted lottery draw ([0500](0500.md)) |
| 25–28 | Conference Semifinal losers | Random draw |
| 29–30 | Conference Finals losers | Random draw |
| 31 | NBA Finals runner-up | Fixed |
| 32 | NBA Champion | Fixed |
| 33–64 | All 32 teams | Same order as picks 1–32 |

### Pick Trades

Pick trades — including protections, rollovers, and swap rights — work the same as in the current NBA system. Protection language should be number-based (e.g., "top-5 protected") rather than status-based. While "lottery protected" is technically still enforceable as a status, its intended meaning — protecting a pick when a team is struggling — no longer maps cleanly onto lottery eligibility, which is now tied to tournament performance rather than record.

## Rationale

### Why non-lottery teams are ordered by reverse tournament finish

The principle established in [0500](0500.md) is that draft positioning should reflect tournament performance, not regular season record. Applying this principle to non-lottery teams means the team that advanced furthest in the tournament picks last. The champion picks last, the runner-up picks second-to-last, and so on. This is consistent, easy to understand, and entirely free of regular season record as an input.

### Why random draw breaks ties within an elimination round

Four teams lose in the Conference Semifinals each year. Ordering them by regular season record would reintroduce tanking incentives. A random draw is neutral, consistent with the anti-tanking philosophy, and requires no additional performance data.

### Why the second round follows first-round order

The lottery draw already produced a fair order through a weighted mechanism tied to tournament performance. Reversing it for the second round — a snake draft — would introduce a compensation logic that exists nowhere else in the system and would partially undermine the lottery result. A team awarded pick 1 by the lottery should not receive the worst relative position in the second round as a tradeoff. The straight format is consistent and requires no additional mechanism.

### Why pick protections must be number-based

In the current NBA system, "lottery protected" is shorthand for a team being among the worst in the league, since lottery eligibility is tied to regular season record. Under this system, lottery eligibility is tied to tournament performance — any team eliminated before the Conference Semifinals qualifies, regardless of regular season record. A strong regular season team that exits the tournament early is lottery eligible; a weaker team that runs deep is not. "Lottery protected" is technically still enforceable as a status designation, but its original intent no longer maps cleanly onto that status. Number-based protections are unambiguous and avoid this confusion.
