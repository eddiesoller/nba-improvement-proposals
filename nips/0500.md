# 0500: Draft Lottery

## Summary

Replace the existing draft lottery system — which ties odds to regular season record — with a system that ties lottery odds solely to tournament performance as defined in [0300](0300.md), eliminating the incentive to lose regular season games and greatly reducing the incentive to lose early in the tournament.

## Motivation

The current NBA draft lottery grants better odds to teams with worse regular season records. This creates a direct incentive for organizations to lose games on purpose. A team that finishes with the worst record in the league receives the best lottery odds.

This proposal severs the link between regular season record and lottery positioning entirely. Lottery odds are determined by how far a team progressed in the postseason tournament before being eliminated. A team cannot improve its draft position by finishing with a worse regular season record.

The mechanism changes, but the spirit of the original lottery is preserved. Teams that struggle in the postseason — exiting early and landing in favorable lottery tiers — will still receive preferential access to top draft talent over time. The intent to rebalance the league by directing better draft picks toward weaker teams remains intact; it is now operationalized through tournament performance rather than record.

## Proposal

### Lottery Eligibility

Teams eliminated before the Conference Semifinals are lottery eligible. Teams that reach the Conference Semifinals or beyond are not.

| Eliminated In | Lottery Eligible |
|--------------|-----------------|
| First Round | Yes |
| Second Round | Yes |
| Third Round | Yes |
| Conference Semifinals | No |
| Conference Finals | No |
| NBA Finals | No |

### Lottery Tiers

Lottery odds are determined by the number of tournament rounds a team appeared in before being eliminated. A team that loses in its first postseason appearance receives better odds than one that won a round before being eliminated. Teams eliminated in the same number of appearances receive identical odds.

Because teams enter the bracket at different rounds depending on their seed, the number of appearances is counted from each team's first tournament game regardless of which round that is. A Seed 2 team that loses their first game in the Third Round has appeared in 1 round. A lower-seeded team that won the First and Second Rounds before losing in the Third Round has appeared in 3 rounds.

This produces three tiers:

| Tier | Rounds Appeared | Points | Description |
|------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 1 | 5 | Lost in first postseason appearance |
| 2 | 2 | 4 | Won one game, lost in second appearance |
| 3 | 3 | 3 | Won two games, lost in third appearance |

The exact number of teams in each tier varies by year depending on which teams win and lose in each round. Per-team odds are computed from the actual tier distribution following each tournament.

### Odds Formula

Each team's lottery odds equal their tier's points divided by the total points across all eligible teams that year:

> **Odds = Tier Points ÷ Sum of All Eligible Teams' Points**

### 15-Team Conference Format

In the 15-team format, each conference produces 11 lottery-eligible teams (4 from the First Round + 4 from the Second Round + 3 from the Third Round), for a league-wide pool of **22 eligible teams**.

The Third Round produces 3 losers per conference. Their tier assignments depend on results: a higher seed losing their first game is Tier 1, while a lower seed that won the First and Second Rounds before losing the Third Round is Tier 3.

*Illustrative calculation* — if in a given year the 22 eligible teams break down as 10 Tier 1, 8 Tier 2, and 4 Tier 3:

Total points = (10 × 5) + (8 × 4) + (4 × 3) = 50 + 32 + 12 = **94 points**

| Tier | Points | Odds Per Team |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | 5 | 5/94 ≈ **5.32%** |
| 2 | 4 | 4/94 ≈ **4.26%** |
| 3 | 3 | 3/94 ≈ **3.19%** |

### 16-Team Conference Format

In the 16-team format, each conference produces 12 lottery-eligible teams (4 from the First Round + 4 from the Second Round + 4 from the Third Round), for a league-wide pool of **24 eligible teams**.

The Third Round produces 4 losers per conference. As in the 15-team format, tier assignments depend on each team's path through the bracket.

*Illustrative calculation* — if in a given year the 24 eligible teams break down as 12 Tier 1, 8 Tier 2, and 4 Tier 3:

Total points = (12 × 5) + (8 × 4) + (4 × 3) = 60 + 32 + 12 = **104 points**

| Tier | Points | Odds Per Team |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | 5 | 5/104 ≈ **4.81%** |
| 2 | 4 | 4/104 ≈ **3.85%** |
| 3 | 3 | 3/104 ≈ **2.88%** |

### Lottery Draw

Teams are drawn sequentially from pick 1 onward. For each pick, a weighted draw is conducted across all teams not yet drawn, with each team's probability proportional to their tier points relative to the remaining pool's total points. Once a team is drawn, they are removed from the pool and odds are recalculated before the next draw. Regular season record has no influence anywhere in this process.

The lottery determines the order of picks 1 through 22 (15-team format) or 1 through 24 (16-team format). The ordering of non-lottery teams and the full two-round draft structure are defined in [0600](0600.md).

## Rationale

### Why lottery odds track rounds appeared rather than seed

Tying lottery odds to seed — even indirectly — preserves an incentive to finish with a worse regular season record. Tying odds entirely to tournament performance eliminates this incentive completely. A Seed 15 and a Seed 9 eliminated in their first postseason appearance receive identical lottery odds. There is no lottery benefit to finishing 15th instead of 9th.

### Why lottery eligibility ends at the Conference Semifinals

Teams that reach the Conference Semifinals have won multiple consecutive games to get there. At that stage, genuine championship contention makes organizational tanking implausible — players, coaches, and owners all have strong incentives to keep winning. Setting the cutoff at the Semis identifies a natural behavioral threshold. Teams inside the cutoff are competing for a title; teams outside it are competing for draft positioning.

### Why all lottery picks are determined by draw

Reverting to any secondary ordering criterion for later picks would risk reintroducing tanking incentives. Determining all lottery positions through sequential weighted draws ensures no non-tournament factor influences draft positioning.

### Why the points ratio is 5-4-3

The ratio is intentionally compressed. A steeper ratio — such as 10-4-1 — would create meaningful incentives to lose early in the tournament. A flatter ratio — such as 3-2-1 — would make the tiers nearly indistinguishable. The 5-4-3 ratio produces roughly a 2 percentage point spread between the best and worst per-team lottery odds, which is informative without being incentivizing.

To put that spread in context: under the current lottery system, the difference in odds between the team with the worst record and the team with the 14th-worst record can exceed 14 percentage points. An organization that shifts from the 14th spot to the 1st spot under the current system gains a substantial lottery edge. Under this system, a team that somehow managed to lose in Round 1 rather than Round 2 gains roughly 1 percentage point — a marginal advantage far too small to justify the organizational and reputational cost of deliberate losing.

Single-elimination format further reduces the practical risk. Players competing in elimination games have strong individual incentives — contracts, playoff bonuses, and career reputation — to win regardless of any front-office calculus. Coordinating a deliberate loss across an entire roster in a playoff game is organizationally implausible. The combination of a minimal odds differential and a format that aligns player and organizational incentives in the direction of winning makes tournament tanking both difficult to execute and minimally rewarding if achieved.
