# 0200: Standings

## Summary

Define the tiebreaker hierarchy for conference standings and playoff seeding. The key change from the current system is elevating cumulative point differential above division and conference record, giving teams a competitive incentive in every period of the regular season.

## Motivation

This proposal is part of a coordinated effort to eliminate tanking and keep regular season games competitive. Because all teams participate in the postseason regardless of record (see [0300](0300.md)), every game carries seeding implications from opening night through the final day. The match scoring system defined in [0100](0100.md) accumulates point differential across all periods, including ceremonial ones. By elevating that differential above division and conference record in the tiebreaker hierarchy, this proposal ensures teams have a genuine competitive incentive in every period of every game — including decided matches.

## Proposal

### Standings

Teams are ranked within their conference by match record. A win counts as one win regardless of the period score within the match. Conference standings determine seeding for the postseason tournament defined in [0300](0300.md), with the best record in each conference seeded first.

### Tiebreaker Hierarchy

When two or more teams finish the regular season with identical match records within a conference, the following criteria are applied in order until the tie is broken. Point differential figures include all periods and sudden death points, as defined in [0100](0100.md).

**1. Head-to-head record**
The record among games played between the tied teams only. For a two-way tie, this is the head-to-head record between those two teams. For a three-or-more-way tie, this is each team's record against all other teams in the tied group.

For multi-way ties, if one team holds a winning record against all others in the group, that team is seeded highest and removed from the group. The remaining teams restart the tiebreaker process from criterion 1. If no single team holds a winning record against all others, head-to-head record is skipped and the group proceeds to criterion 2.

**2. Head-to-head point differential**
Cumulative point differential across all games played between the tied teams only. The same multi-way logic applies: if one team's cumulative head-to-head differential across all games against the other teams in the group is positive, that team advances; otherwise this criterion is skipped and the group proceeds to criterion 3.

**3. Overall point differential**
Cumulative point differential across all regular season games.

**4. Division record**
Applied only if all tied teams are members of the same division. Each team's record against all other teams within the division. If the tied teams are not all in the same division, this criterion is skipped entirely and the group proceeds to criterion 5.

**5. Conference record**
Each team's record against all other teams within the conference.

**6. Random draw**
If all preceding criteria are exhausted without resolution, seeding is determined by a random draw conducted by the league.

## Rationale

### Why overall point differential is criterion 3 rather than later

The primary motivation is to give ceremonial periods real stakes. A team competing for seeding position has a reason to play hard even in a decided match, because every period of point differential counts toward their tiebreaker standing. Point differential is also a richer and more continuous signal than binary win-loss records against a subset of the schedule — a team that dominated opponents all season deserves higher seeding than one that narrowly won the same number of matches. This follows the EuroLeague tiebreaker model, which places overall differential immediately after head-to-head results.

### Why division record is retained but conditionally

Division record is a meaningful tiebreaker when all tied teams share a division because it directly measures how they fared against common opponents in a geographically coherent group. It is skipped when teams are from different divisions because cross-divisional schedules are not symmetric, making direct comparison less valid. This mirrors the NBA's existing approach.

### Why multi-way head-to-head requires dominance to apply

In a multi-way tie, head-to-head record only separates a team if that team beat all others in the group. Partial head-to-head advantages — such as 2-1 in a three-way tie — are inconclusive and could produce circular results. Requiring a clear dominant team before applying the criterion prevents ambiguous outcomes and ensures the tiebreaker resolves cleanly.
