# 0001: NIP Template and Style Guide

## Summary

This document defines the standard template and style conventions for all NBA Improvement Proposals (NIPs).

## Overview

Consistent structure makes proposals easier to read, evaluate, and compare. All NIPs numbered 0100 and above should follow the template defined in this document. Meta NIPs (0000–0099) may deviate from the template where appropriate.

## Template

The following sections are required for all proposal NIPs. Each section is described below.

---

```markdown
# XXXX: Title

## Summary

One or two sentences describing what this proposal does and why it matters.

## Motivation

A description of the problem this proposal addresses. This section should explain
what is broken or suboptimal about the current system, and why it matters enough
to warrant a formal proposal. Concrete examples are encouraged.

## Proposal

The substantive content of the proposal. This section should be detailed enough
that someone could evaluate whether the proposal would work and how it would
be implemented. Use subsections (###) to organize complex proposals.

## Rationale

An explanation of key design decisions. This section should address why this
approach was chosen over plausible alternatives, and acknowledge any significant
tradeoffs the proposal makes.

## Changelog

The changelog records significant changes to the proposal — structural revisions, updated design decisions, or meaningful additions to the content. It should not be updated for typo fixes, minor clarifications, or added context that doesn't change the proposal's substance.

## Style Guide

**Titles** should be concise and describe the thing being proposed, not the problem it solves. Prefer "Postseason" over "Fix the Playoff Tanking Problem."

**Summary** should be one to two sentences. A reader should understand the proposal's core idea without reading further.

**Motivation** should be honest about the problem. Avoid overstating or sensationalizing. Where quantitative evidence exists, use it.

**Proposal** should be specific. Vague proposals are difficult to evaluate. If a design decision has not been made, say so explicitly rather than leaving it implicit.

**Rationale** is not a repetition of the Proposal. It should explain *why* — why this structure rather than another, why this threshold rather than a different one, why a tradeoff was accepted.

**Changelog** entries should be dated and describe what changed, not just that something changed.
