# 0000: What is a NIP?

## Summary

NBA Improvement Proposals (NIPs) are design documents proposing structural or rules-based improvements to the NBA. Each NIP defines a problem, proposes a solution, and explains the reasoning behind key design decisions.

## Overview

The NBA has accumulated rules, structures, and incentive systems over decades, many of which were designed for a different era of the league. Some of these systems produce unintended consequences — such as incentivizing teams to lose games on purpose — that undermine the integrity of the sport.

NIPs exist to propose thoughtful, well-reasoned alternatives to these systems. They are not official NBA policy documents. They are an open effort to articulate what better rules could look like, in enough detail that the ideas can be evaluated, debated, and refined.

The format is inspired by [Google's API Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev), which use structured documents to propose and document design standards. The same discipline that makes API design documents useful — clear problem statements, explicit rationale, acknowledgment of tradeoffs — applies equally well to sports governance.

## What a NIP Is

A NIP is a document that:

- Identifies a specific structural or rules-based problem with the NBA
- Proposes a concrete solution with enough detail to evaluate it
- Explains why key design decisions were made the way they were
- Acknowledges tradeoffs and alternatives where relevant

## What a NIP Is Not

A NIP is not a complaint, a hot take, or a vague wish. It is not a prediction about what the NBA will do. It is not binding on anyone. A NIP is a proposal — an argument for a better design, made in good faith and open to scrutiny.

## Numbering

NIPs are identified by four-digit numbers. Numbers 0000–0099 are reserved for meta NIPs that define the process itself. Numbers 0100 and above are for substantive proposals, organized into series by topic:

- **0100 series** — Rules
- **0200 series** — Regular Season
- **0300 series** — Postseason
- **0400 series** — In-Season tournament
- **0500 series** — Draft Lottery
- **0600 series** — Draft
