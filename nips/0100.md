# 0100: Match Scoring

## Summary

Replace cumulative game scoring with a best-of-five period format in which each 12-minute period is scored independently and the first team to win 3 periods wins the match.

## Motivation

The current NBA scoring system — highest cumulative score after four 12-minute quarters wins — produces two structural problems that diminish the entertainment value and competitive integrity of individual games.

**Blowouts effectively end games early.** A team trailing by 30 points with two quarters remaining has no realistic path to victory. Casual fans stop watching, stars are rested, and a significant portion of the game is played out as a formality. This is not an edge case — blowouts are common at every stage of the season and playoffs.

**Only the final minutes of close games carry real stakes.** Even in a competitive game, the first three quarters function primarily as context for the fourth. Leads built over 36 minutes can be surrendered in 4 minutes, which means early periods carry little weight and fans learn to tune in late. The game rewards the last team to score more than the team that competed hardest over the full contest.

Both problems stem from the same root cause: every point scored in the first minute is mathematically identical to every point scored in the final minute. This proposal addresses that by making each period a discrete, independently scored unit with its own winner.

## Proposal

### Match Format

Each game is a best-of-five: the first team to win 3 periods wins the match. Each period is 12 minutes. A minimum of 4 periods are always played — if one team clinches 3–0 after three periods, the fourth period is still played as a ceremonial period. If the match is tied 2–2 after four periods, a fifth period is played to determine the winner.

### Period Outcomes

Each period produces exactly one winner. The team with the higher score at the end of 12 minutes wins the period.

If the score is tied at the end of 12 minutes, the period enters **sudden death**: play continues and the next team to score any points — by any means — wins the period immediately. There are no timeouts during sudden death.

### Ceremonial Period

When a team clinches the match 3–0 after three periods, period 4 is played under normal rules but carries no bearing on the match outcome. Coaches are expected to use this period for player development and lineup experimentation. There are no restrictions on which players may appear. Ceremonial periods count toward cumulative point differential, which is used as a standings tiebreaker in [0200](0200.md).

### Score Reporting

Match results are reported in two components: the period score and the individual period scores.

*Example:* **MIL 3 – BOS 1** (28-24, 22-31, 19-18†, 25-22)

The period score appears first. Individual period scores are listed in parentheses in chronological order, with the match winner's score listed first in each pair. A dagger (†) denotes a period decided by sudden death, where the period was tied at the end of regulation and MIL scored the next basket.

## Rationale

### Why period scoring rather than cumulative scoring

The core problem with cumulative scoring is that early period performance is permanently discounted by late-game variance. Period scoring makes each 12-minute unit carry equal structural weight — a period won by 1 point is identical to a period won by 20 in determining the match outcome. This does not eliminate the value of scoring more points within a period, but it does eliminate the snowball effect that makes large deficits unrecoverable.

### Why 4 periods minimum rather than ending on clinch

Without a minimum, a 3–0 sweep would end a game after 36 minutes — shorter than current regulation. Broadcasting contracts, arena operations, and fan expectations are all structured around a consistent game length, so ending early creates logistical and commercial friction. The 4-period floor avoids this while providing genuine secondary value: player development, lineup experimentation, and point differential competition.

### Why sudden death for tied periods rather than a short overtime

A fixed overtime interval reintroduces the cumulative scoring problem within the overtime itself. Sudden death is immediate, legible, and creates a genuine high-leverage moment. The next-basket format requires no explanation. Prohibiting timeouts during sudden death prevents the format from becoming a free throw exchange and preserves the drama of live play.
