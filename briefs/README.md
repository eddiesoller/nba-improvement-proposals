# Briefs

Briefs are short, casual explanations of how the NIPs address specific issues in the NBA. Where a NIP is a formal design document — structured, detailed, and written for evaluation — a brief is written for anyone who wants to understand the ideas without wading through the full proposals.

Each brief covers a topic, explains the problem, and walks through how the relevant NIPs solve it with links to the underlying proposals.
