# NBA Improvement Proposals

NBA Improvement Proposals (NIPs) are a series of design documents proposing structural and rules-based improvements to the NBA. Each NIP is a self-contained proposal covering a specific problem, a proposed solution, and the rationale behind the design decisions.

This project is inspired by [Google's API Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev), adapting the same format for NBA reform.
